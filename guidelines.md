# Comprehensive Implementation Guidelines for Multiplayer Car Simulator

## Project Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for implementing a web-based multiplayer car simulator with the following key features:
- Real-time multiplayer functionality
- Infinite procedurally generated worlds with alternating city and countryside environments
- Blocky, Roblox-like aesthetic
- Basic car customization (color selection)
- Desktop browser support
- Focus on implementation simplicity rather than performance optimization

## Architectural Framework

### Frontend Architecture

#### Technology Stack
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for faster development and optimized production builds
- **Three.js**: Implement for 3D rendering of the game world and vehicles
- **WebGL**: Leverage Three.js' WebGL capabilities for rendering the game environment
- **Zustand**: Simple, fast state management library for game state

#### Application Structure
- Implement a single-page application (SPA) architecture
- Separate concerns using a component-based architecture:
  - `WorldRenderer`: Manages Three.js scene and camera
  - `VehicleController`: Handles player input and physics calculations
  - `NetworkManager`: Manages Socket.IO connections and state synchronization
  - `UIComponents`: Handles user interface elements (color picker, connection status, etc.)
  - `ChunkManager`: Manages loading and unloading of world chunks

#### State Management
- Use Zustand for global game state management
- Implement separate stores for different domains (UI, game world, networking)
- Separate local state (UI, input) from networked state (player positions, world state)

### Backend Architecture

#### Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: Server runtime environment
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Express**: HTTP server framework for serving static assets and API endpoints
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication library

#### Server Components
- **GameServer**: Main server class that initializes and manages the game state
- **WorldGenerator**: Handles procedural generation of the game world
- **PlayerManager**: Tracks connected players and their state
- **PhysicsManager**: Performs server-side physics calculations for validation
- **NetworkManager**: Handles Socket.IO connections and message broadcasting

## Core Systems Implementation
